# Employee Tracking System

## Description

My motivation for this project was to provide an easy system for many companies to be able to manage and update their employees in one location.
I built this project as a way to test and learn more about how postgres and javascript are able to work together to create a flexible application.
This provides a clean one stop shop place for employers to manage their workforce.
Going through this project, I learned the alternative use of switch/case statements instead of if/else statements.

## Installation

To install this project, simply download the index.js, connection.js, and schema.sql files to your local computer. Once you have these downloaded, ensure to install the template through postgres to your computer. If you need to make changes to your departments, edit the file before installing.

## Usage

To use this application, you will need to open your terminal. Once you have it open, type in "node index.js" to launch the application.
The following video provides details on how the application can be used to track your employees.
